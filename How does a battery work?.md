# How does a battery work?
A battery consists of a cathode and an anode<br>
It is powered by chemical reactions with varying energy potentials<br>

## Anode
At the anode, oxidation occurs. This means that electrons are given off. <br>
A chemical reaction occurs causing electrons to be given off once the ciruit is closes

## Cathode
At the cathode, reduction occurs. This means that electrons are gained <br>
A chemical reaction occurs causing electrons to be given off once the ciruit is closes

## Electrolyte
A gel like substance, called an electrolyte is found inside the battery. <br>
It enables ions that are product of the chemical equations to be transferred between electrodes.
