A PN junction (also known as a diode) is formed by joining P-type and N-type semiconductors:

P-type materials: Have an excess of holes (positive charge carriers). <br>
N-type materials: Have an excess of electrons (negative charge carriers).

P and N type semiconductors are made by adding impurities to pure semiconductors such as silicon (except at 0 Kelvin) and germanium

The p-n junction is regularly shaped like a cylinder with p-type at the anode and the n-type at the cathode

### Depletion Layer
This is an element of the diode that occurs when electrons from n-type material fill in the holes in p-type material. <br>
An area of insulation is formed in the center, where there are no conducting holes or electrons. <br>
In the depletion layer, one side is more positively charged and one side is more negatively charged. This creates an electric field in the depletion layer in the direction of the Anode. <br>

### Forward Bias
This is when the negative terminal of the battery is connected to the Cathode and the positive terminal of the battery is connected to the Anode. <br>
Electrons are free to pass <br>

### Reversed Bias
This is when the positive terminal of the battery is connected to the Cathode and the negative terminal of the battery is connected to the Anode. <br>
Holes are attracted to the Anode and Electrons are attracted to the Cathode. <br>
A gap is made in the diode in which no current can flow, an insulating layer. <br>
Current cannot pass though a diode in Reversed Bias. <br>
