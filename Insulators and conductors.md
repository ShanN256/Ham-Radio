Insulators resist charge from flowing<br>
Conductors allow charge to flow freely

### But why does this happen?

It's due to the complexion of the atoms in each material. <br>
See in a conductor the materials atoms have electrons that are loosely bound to it's protons compared to an insulator. <br>
Since the electrons orbit is loosely bound, it can tranfer to other atoms more easily.

In an insulator, the electrons are far more tightly bounder to the protons in the atom, making it harder for electrons to be tranfered<br>
I.e. more force is required to break the bond.
