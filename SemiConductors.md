A semiconductor is a material whos resistivity falls between a good insulator and a good conductor

Semiconductors such as silicon are naturally resistive due to the lack of conductance electrons but with the following methods, resistivity can be altered: <br>
- Temperature
- Light
- Doping

Doping is the addition of impurities to a pure semiconductor to increase its conductivity<br>

N - type doping<br>
Addition of impurities to increase the amount of electrons available for conductance<br>
E.g phosphorous and silicon<br>

P - type doping <br>
Addition of impurities to increase the amount of holes (positive charge due to the absence of electrons caused by the protons in the atom) available for conductance <br>
E.g boron and silicon<br>

Temperature <br>
By increasing the temperature of a semiconductor such as silicon, electrons are given enough energy to break from it's bonds creating a hole as it leaves <br>
By observing the relationship between resistivity and temperature in a semiconductor, we can sense temperature fluctuations. <br>
E.g such as in thermistors

Light <br>
I belive a similar principle applies for a semiconductor that is exposed to ligh <br>
E.g in a photoresistor

p-n junctions <br>
When a p type and an n type semiconductor is sandwitched together, we can this a pn junction.<br>
This is the theory behind diodes <br>
