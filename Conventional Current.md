# What's the difference between Conventional Current and electron flow

Conventional current is a "convention." It's a way to show the direction of positive charge flow
Current flows from positive to negative elctrodes.
What gets used up in an electrical ciruit? the electrons, the protons the batteries emf?

Electron flow is opposite in direction to Conventional current. Electrons move from lower potential to higher potential.

Although current is the rate at which charge passes in a circuit, it does not influence the direction.
